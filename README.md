# 🛠️ Jet Turbine Simulation - Augmented Reality Experience

**Jet Turbine Simulation** is a cutting-edge Augmented Reality (AR) application that allows users to explore the inner workings of a jet turbine engine in an immersive and interactive way.

## 🚀 Overview

This project brings complex jet turbine technology into your hands using AR. By simply launching the app, users can place a fully 3D-rendered turbine in their environment and inspect each component — from the fan blades to the combustion chamber — up close.

Whether you're a student, educator, engineer, or just curious about how jet engines work, this app offers an intuitive and educational journey inside the mechanics of flight.
